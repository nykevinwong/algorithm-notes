(1) must know the optimized approach with lowest time complexity.
(2) if the optimized approach is difficult to understand, pick the easier code with reasonable time complexity.
(3) must see if the brute force has connection to optimzed approach. this help you to quickly recognize the optimized approach when just seeing the brute force code.
