Insertion sort algorithm for ascending order
Itâ€™s easier to think about the insertion sort if we begin in the middle of the process, when the data is half sorted.
start from first index of the array do the following:

1. store your current item value in a temporary varaible before each comparsion.
2. compare each item on the left. 
3. if it's bigger, then copy the bigger item to current item index position. current item index is now changed to this one.
4. if it's smaller, then the sorting is stopped.
